## Claim

The unseeded story acquires Matock item 17 from Bogard's authored chest through live AddBox/OpenDoor/inventory semantics in a renderless offscreen run.

## Evidence

tools/verify.sh continuous Matock chest gate: room exit into M0010_00_00, opened box and acquired item 17, settled requested item 17, offscreen driver, zero decoded audio.

## What would falsify it

Any mandatory run fails to enter M0010_00_00, fails to fire _BOX/acquire item 17, decodes audio, or uses a visible/rendered non-capture path.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the windowless render bypass, OpenDoor, inventory bridge, and Matock chest changes; all gameplay, self-test, corpus, frontier, and generated-artifact gates passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the post-Matock route-planner fix; all continuous fixed-step offscreen gates, focused self-tests, negative discriminators, exact asset corpus checks, the 993-room census, and the new 6279-frame silent route to M0000_10_06 passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed 2026-08-14 after replacing the false Chocobot-detour gate: all existing discriminators passed, and the corrected unseeded continuation reached M0011_00_02 in 6785 fixed-step uncapped offscreen frames with zero gameplay audio decode.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Reconfirmed against pushed commit 61c7781; its pre-commit full ./tools/verify.sh pass exercised the identical tree, including all existing discriminators and the corrected 6785-frame offscreen silent M0011_00_02 continuation.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the Silver Key doorway changes, including all asset/parser negative controls, gameplay gates, selftests, 993-room census, cmd API, world map, and the continuous offscreen/no-audio progression through M0013_03_01.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Final full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after removing unused route branches; all parser negatives, gameplay gates, selftests, 993-room census, command/world-map checks, and continuous offscreen/no-audio progression through M0013_03_01 passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the Hydra-dungeon pressure-switch changes, including all negatives, gameplay gates through M0013_00_04, 48/48 movement cases, 993-room census, cmd API, and world-map checks.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the Hydra mountain change; all claim-specific self-tests and continuous fixed-step offscreen zero-audio progression gates passed.
