## Claim

An unseeded new game continuously completes the heroine encounter at scenario state 12

## Evidence

2026-08-14 full ./tools/verify.sh pass: offscreen fixed-step --opening-story --continue-story run completed in 4124 frames, traversed five WALL_UP and three WALL_DN pairs, spawned and engine-placed three Myconids through AddEnemyZaco, seeded all three from enemydat.bin, killed all three, fired EnemyDead, completed Hasim dialogue, and stopped settled at sccnt=12 with zero live coroutines and zero decoded audio frames.

## What would falsify it

Falsified if the mandatory heroine gate no longer starts from an unseeded new game, does not observe exactly five upward and three downward vine traversals, does not create/place/seed/kill all three Myconids and fire EnemyDead, fails to settle at sccnt=12, opens a visible window, or decodes audio.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after inverse-vine routing, AddEnemyZaco, repeatable late placement, and offscreen story-gate changes; all focused self-tests, negative discriminators, continuous story gates, exact asset corpus, and room census passed. The heroine gate settled at sccnt=12 after five WALL_UP and three WALL_DN traversals with zero decoded audio frames.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after persistent binary-named party identities and the sccnt=12-to-14 return route landed; all continuous story gates, focused self-tests, negative discriminators, exact asset corpus checks, and the 993-room census passed. The newest gate restored live PARTY_HEROINE across nine room loads and settled at sccnt=14 after 5202 offscreen fixed-step frames with zero decoded audio.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Final full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 with the repository-owned RE-frontier validator and its zero-entry negative enabled. All continuous story gates, self-tests, negative discriminators, exact 9886-member corpus checks, and 993-room census passed; PARTY_HEROINE remained live at settled sccnt=14 after 5202 offscreen frames with zero decoded audio.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the windowless render bypass, OpenDoor, inventory bridge, and Matock chest changes; all gameplay, self-test, corpus, frontier, and generated-artifact gates passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the post-Matock route-planner fix; all continuous fixed-step offscreen gates, focused self-tests, negative discriminators, exact asset corpus checks, the 993-room census, and the new 6279-frame silent route to M0000_10_06 passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed 2026-08-14 after replacing the false Chocobot-detour gate: all existing discriminators passed, and the corrected unseeded continuation reached M0011_00_02 in 6785 fixed-step uncapped offscreen frames with zero gameplay audio decode.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Reconfirmed against pushed commit 61c7781; its pre-commit full ./tools/verify.sh pass exercised the identical tree, including all existing discriminators and the corrected 6785-frame offscreen silent M0011_00_02 continuation.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the Silver Key doorway changes, including all asset/parser negative controls, gameplay gates, selftests, 993-room census, cmd API, world map, and the continuous offscreen/no-audio progression through M0013_03_01.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Final full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after removing unused route branches; all parser negatives, gameplay gates, selftests, 993-room census, command/world-map checks, and continuous offscreen/no-audio progression through M0013_03_01 passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the Hydra-dungeon pressure-switch changes, including all negatives, gameplay gates through M0013_00_04, 48/48 movement cases, 993-room census, cmd API, and world-map checks.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the Hydra mountain change; all claim-specific self-tests and continuous fixed-step offscreen zero-audio progression gates passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the verifier was made to rebuild mana first; 62 inventory cases and all continuous offscreen zero-audio gates passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full offscreen/dummy-audio fixed-step gate tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14; scratch/logs/verify-keyring-structure-v4.log ends VERIFICATION OK.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Commit af6e3c5 passed the complete offscreen/dummy-audio fixed-step tools/verify.sh gate on 2026-08-14; gameplay and static/corpus evidence is recorded under scratch/logs/.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Commit fe20918 passed the complete fixed-step uncapped offscreen/dummy-audio tools/verify.sh gate through Hydra's authored sccnt=16 defeat transition on 2026-08-14; evidence is scratch/logs/verify-hydra-defeat.log.
