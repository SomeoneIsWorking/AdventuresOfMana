## Claim

The unseeded offscreen story run crosses the Hydra upper log and reaches M0013_01_00

## Evidence

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14: mandatory fixed-step uncapped run rejected exact tangent floor ownership at M0013_00_04, chose y=90, entered left_1, mapjumped to west M0013_02_00, exited into M0013_01_00 after 12,369 frames, used SDL offscreen, and decoded 0 audio frames.

## What would falsify it

A continuous unseeded run fails to reach M0013_01_00 through left_1, accepts the exactly tangent arrival box as overlapping, opens a window, or decodes any audio.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the Hydra mountain change; all claim-specific self-tests and continuous fixed-step offscreen zero-audio progression gates passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the verifier was made to rebuild mana first; 62 inventory cases and all continuous offscreen zero-audio gates passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full offscreen/dummy-audio fixed-step gate tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14; scratch/logs/verify-keyring-structure-v4.log ends VERIFICATION OK.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Commit af6e3c5 passed the complete offscreen/dummy-audio fixed-step tools/verify.sh gate on 2026-08-14; gameplay and static/corpus evidence is recorded under scratch/logs/.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Commit fe20918 passed the complete fixed-step uncapped offscreen/dummy-audio tools/verify.sh gate through Hydra's authored sccnt=16 defeat transition on 2026-08-14; evidence is scratch/logs/verify-hydra-defeat.log.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Commit a80ff75: the complete mandatory ./tools/verify.sh passed in scratch/logs/verify-steward-wolf.log after the landed changes, exercising this claim's positive and negative checks offscreen; the extended continuous run settled at sccnt=19 with zero decoded audio frames.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Reverified unchanged behavior after commit 6e5d104 by full ./tools/verify.sh: scratch/logs/verify-chain-flail.log ALL PARSERS PASSED on 2026-08-14; mandatory story run was fixed-step uncapped, SDL-offscreen, and decoded 0 audio frames.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14
