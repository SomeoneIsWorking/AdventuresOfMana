## Claim

The unseeded fixed-step uncapped offscreen story run climbs the lone WALL_UP mountain through up_01 and continues to M0013_00_00 with zero decoded audio

## Evidence

tools/verify.sh full gate on 2026-08-14: 12582 frames; entered floor-330 lone WALL_UP, up_01 mapjump, left room exit; audio decoded 0 sounds / 0 frames

## What would falsify it

if the continuous run fires wall_01 during the mountain ascent, returns through down_01, opens a window, decodes audio, or fails to reach M0013_00_00

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the Hydra mountain change; all claim-specific self-tests and continuous fixed-step offscreen zero-audio progression gates passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the verifier was made to rebuild mana first; 62 inventory cases and all continuous offscreen zero-audio gates passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full offscreen/dummy-audio fixed-step gate tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14; scratch/logs/verify-keyring-structure-v4.log ends VERIFICATION OK.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Commit af6e3c5 passed the complete offscreen/dummy-audio fixed-step tools/verify.sh gate on 2026-08-14; gameplay and static/corpus evidence is recorded under scratch/logs/.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Commit fe20918 passed the complete fixed-step uncapped offscreen/dummy-audio tools/verify.sh gate through Hydra's authored sccnt=16 defeat transition on 2026-08-14; evidence is scratch/logs/verify-hydra-defeat.log.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Commit a80ff75: the complete mandatory ./tools/verify.sh passed in scratch/logs/verify-steward-wolf.log after the landed changes, exercising this claim's positive and negative checks offscreen; the extended continuous run settled at sccnt=19 with zero decoded audio frames.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Reverified unchanged behavior after commit 6e5d104 by full ./tools/verify.sh: scratch/logs/verify-chain-flail.log ALL PARSERS PASSED on 2026-08-14; mandatory story run was fixed-step uncapped, SDL-offscreen, and decoded 0 audio frames.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Reverified after commits adedb5d/addb897 by full ./tools/verify.sh: scratch/logs/verify-sdl3-gpu-negative.log ALL PARSERS PASSED on 2026-08-14; mandatory story remained fixed-step uncapped, SDL-offscreen, and decoded 0 audio frames.
