## Claim

An unseeded new game continuously leaves Kett Manor after scenario 15, defeats all five lizardmen across stacked floors, takes the Warrior regimen, and acquires Silver Key item 30 in 10,831 fixed-step offscreen frames with zero decoded audio.

## Evidence

./tools/verify.sh passed its continuous Silver Key gate on 2026-08-14: shipping out_1 mapjump, overworld cells M0000_10_09 through M0000_13_10, exactly five enemy5 kills, Warrior level 2, authored _BOX item 30, SDL offscreen, and 0 decoded sounds/frames; the complete parser/runtime suite ended ALL PARSERS PASSED.

## What would falsify it

Any unseeded ./tools/verify.sh run fails the Silver Key assertions, decodes audio, opens a window, fails to acquire item 30, or changes the cited driver without equivalent re-verification.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the Hydra-dungeon pressure-switch changes; its Silver Key acquisition gate remains mandatory inside the longer progression run.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the Hydra mountain change; all claim-specific self-tests and continuous fixed-step offscreen zero-audio progression gates passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full ./tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14 after the verifier was made to rebuild mana first; 62 inventory cases and all continuous offscreen zero-audio gates passed.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Full offscreen/dummy-audio fixed-step gate tools/verify.sh passed on 2026-08-14; scratch/logs/verify-keyring-structure-v4.log ends VERIFICATION OK.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Commit fe20918 passed the complete fixed-step uncapped offscreen/dummy-audio tools/verify.sh gate through Hydra's authored sccnt=16 defeat transition on 2026-08-14; evidence is scratch/logs/verify-hydra-defeat.log.

## Re-confirmed 2026-08-14

Commit a80ff75: the complete mandatory ./tools/verify.sh passed in scratch/logs/verify-steward-wolf.log after the landed changes, exercising this claim's positive and negative checks offscreen; the extended continuous run settled at sccnt=19 with zero decoded audio frames.
